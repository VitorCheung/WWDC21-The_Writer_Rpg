 # RPG!!
 
Did you enjoy your adventure?
 
What you have just experienced was a small example of an RPG session!
However, this game is a simplified version, because in a real game the fun begins when you star to improvise your actions!
 
 In the end, RPG is just a tool to tell stories, with everyone on the table helping the Dungeon Master.
 
 The Master is just the presenter of the stage for the players to act and run with the story.
 
 ## Story
 
 If you are curious about the possibles endings of the story of the previous page, you can click on the circles to read all paths.
